# github.com/go-crypt/x

Low level library which copies several elements from [golang.org/x/crypto]. For a higher level library see
[github.com/go-crypt/crypt].

## Intent

This library aims to implement feature parity with [golang.org/x/crypto] except for the following alterations:

- Only crypt functions and functions to support these exist
- Expose more methods
- Adjust existing methods to have better uniformity
